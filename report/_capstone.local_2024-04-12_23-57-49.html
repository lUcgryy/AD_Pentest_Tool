                    <div>Kerberos, the protocol at the core of Active Directory security, allows certain servers to obtain a user's credentials and use those to authenticate on behalf of the user.</div>
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    <div>When a user authenticates on a server that is Trusted for delegation, a copy of the user's credentials is sent to the server by the domain controller. These credentials can then be used to authenticate on behalf of the user.</div>
                    
                    
                    <h4>Impact</h4>
                    
                    
                    <div>If an attacker is able to compromise such a server, they will be able to steal and reuse the credentials of all the users authenticating on this particular server. If an administrator connects to the compromised machine, the attacker will be able to escalate their privileges and become an administrator as well. As a consequence, the Trusted for delegation property should only be allowed on trusted servers such as domain controllers. This mechanism is called unconstrained delegation.</div>

                    <div>In an Active Directory environment, reversible encryption refers to the ability to store certain sensitive attributes, such as user passwords, in a format that can be reversed back to its original plaintext form. This feature is primarily used for backward compatibility with legacy systems that may require access to the plaintext passwords.</div>
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    <div>Enabling reversible encryption in Active Directory is generally not recommended from a security standpoint. It weakens the protection of user passwords and exposes them to potential compromise.</div>
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    <div>The first part of this attack is to identify user accounts that have the 'Store password using reversible encryption' option enabled.

                    <div>Active Directory uses the Kerberos protocol for authentication. As it is an old protocol, numerous security hardening measures have been taken since its creation, and some legacy options must be disabled to ensure proper security posture.</div>
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    <div>An attacker can use the AS-REP Roasting attack to guess the users' passwords. The first part of the AS-REP Roasting attack is to identify users for whom the Kerberos pre-authentication is not set (DONT_REQ_PREAUTH). This is part of the userAccountControl attribute.</div>
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    <div>Without Kerberos pre-authentication, an attacker can send an authentication request (AS-REQ) to the KDC on behalf of the user. The KDC will then reply with an encrypted TGT (AS-REP). A part of the AS-REP is encrypted with the original user's key, derived from their own password. The attacker can then use offline bruteforcing to guess the password. This attack is much faster than online bruteforcing (e.g. by making numerous authentication requests with different passwords).</div>
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    <div>Pre-authentication forces the attacker to be in possession of the password (by having to encrypt a timestamp) before the KDC sends back the encrypted TGT.</div>
                    
                    
                    <h4>Impact</h4>
                    
                    
                    <div>In a successful attack, the attacker can gain access to a user's credentials, attackers can potentially escalate privileges, access sensitive data, and move laterally within a network.</div>
